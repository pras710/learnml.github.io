		Author's preface: Why we need this intro to ML (a CSE grad's perspective)
	</head>

		<p>
		It is not difficult to argue that ML is the most important field of science today. It has broken long existing barriers and help make tremendous progress on tradtionally stuck problems, enriched lives thus, etc.
		However, ML is also becoming a niche and disconnected subject for many people in the mainstream CSE fields.
		People who apply ML in their respective traditional fields of research are considered pioneers and path breakers.
		They often end up with bettering the State of art, although with a slight inconvenience of not able to explain how/why that happened.

		<p>
		While it is an important problem -- this set of notes/book is not going to delve and answer how/why ML is helping us get better results.
		However, the purpose I am setting for this book is to introduce and explain what ML is for different communities of classic computer science people.
		In that process, I am also planning on updating my very limited understanding of what is going on in ML today.
		</p>
		<p>
		PS: I am going to use ML to denote whatever pytorch, tf, etc are capable of doing. 
		Please feel free to correct/edit/open a Pull request, if I should be using the term AI instead of ML or vice versa.
